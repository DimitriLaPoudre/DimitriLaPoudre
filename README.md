## Interests
**Discovering and trying new things**
- Trying to achieve maximum **optimisation** for fun with ***ASM*** and I discover so many new things
- I wanted to try **rendering a window** from flat ASM so I built **[AsmGraphic](https://github.com/DimitriLaPoudre/AsmGraphic)** an x11 wrapper from **scratch**

**Want to be versatile to not depend on others**
- When I needed a way to **feed** my music library I built **[MusicShack](https://github.com/DimitriLaPoudre/MusicShack)**, learning at the same time a **new** stack: ***Go***/***Svelte***

**Understanding my work environnement**
- I am currently trying Nixos to see and understand the goals and benefits of a declarative OS
- I left VSCode for NeoVim to try and understand this niche; I lose nothing but gain powerful keybindings

## Currently working on
**[MusicShack](https://github.com/DimitriLaPoudre/MusicShack)**
- Lightweight Stack(**Go**/**Svelte**) music library manager
- Import system based on plugins that can import from various sources into the library
- Follow your favorite artists to fetch all their new songs upon release

## Objective
Achieving the most knowledge possible to be able to build everything I need without limits  
*I'll certainly have more precise goals in the future but for now that's it*
