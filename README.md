## Interest
**Discovering and trying new things**
- Trying to achieve maximum **optimisation** for fun with ***ASM*** and I discovering so much new things
- I wanted to try **render a window** from flat ASM so I build **[AsmGraphic](https://github.com/DimitriLaPoudre/AsmGraphic)** an x11 wrapper from **scratch**

**Want to be polyvalent for not depend on other**
- When I needed a way to **feed** my music library I built **[MusicShack](https://github.com/DimitriLaPoudre/MusicShack)** learning at the same time a **new** stack: ***Go***/***Svelte***

**Understand my work environnement**
- I actually try Nixos to see and understand the goal and benefit of a declarative OS
- I leave VSCode for NeoVim to try and understand this niche and I lose nothing but gain powerful keybind

## Currently working on
**[MusicShack](https://github.com/DimitriLaPoudre/MusicShack)**
- Lightweight Stack(**Go**/**Svelte**) music library manager
- Import system based on plugins that can import from various sources to the library
- Follow your favorites artists to fetch all their new songs at release

## Objectif
Achieving the most knowledge possible to be able to build every of my need without limit  
*I'll certainly have more precises goals in the future but for now that's it*
